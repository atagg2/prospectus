abstract = {When designing a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft, it is crucial to consider various operating conditions, including hover, wing-borne cruise, and transition. Takeoff transition and climb phases are critical for vehicle conceptual design because they drive the motor and battery sizing. However, these flight phases are often ignored or simplified in the conceptual design literature due to the complexity of transition dynamics. To address this limitation, we propose simultaneous optimization of VTOL aircraft conceptual design and takeoff trajectory. Simultaneous optimization incorporates the takeoff transition and climb flight dynamics into VTOL design optimization in a fully coupled manner. This paper presents the design-trajectory optimization of lift-plus-cruise and tailsitter UAVs for delivery missions. As a result, simultaneous optimization reduces total energy consumption by 7.4% compared to uncoupled optimization and by 4.8% from iterative sequential optimization in the lift-plus-cruise configuration. It also achieves a 29% energy reduction from uncoupled optimization in the tailsitter configuration. Incorporating takeoff trajectory optimization in UAV sizing enables accurate estimation of takeoff and climb energy, which avoids undersizing or oversizing the battery. Furthermore, simultaneous optimization trades the vehicle weight penalty for a more energy-efficient climb with early transition. These system-level trade-offs can only be captured by simultaneous optimization; they cannot be captured by uncoupled or iterative sequential optimization.}

abstract = {The rise of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft has sparked research interest, but attention to modeling and evaluation methods, particularly for vectored thrust eVTOL, lags behind. The intricate flight/propulsion coupling and structure/control complexity contribute to the gap. Moreover, integrated modeling and evaluation processes for vectored thrust eVTOL should fully account for the tilting characteristics of the fan/propeller. This paper proposes a flight/propulsion cooperative control modeling and evaluation method for vectored thrust eVTOL. The methodology uses the Gaussian pseudospectral trajectory optimization method to obtain the overall characteristics and cooperative control strategy of flight/propulsion under strict take-off and landing trajectory constraints. Besides, this paper yielded the parameterized analysis and matching optimization design of the propulsion system. Results indicated that for an aircraft with a take-off weight of 1.8 tons, equipped with four 1.6 m diameter tilting ducted fans and a single discharge rate 5C battery, its cruising range is 135.1 km based on the selected technical parameters. The power consumption accounts for merely 12.6% of the total battery capacity during the take-off phase with high-power demand but short duration. By employing a pack of high-power-density and high-energy-density batteries to drive the ducted fans jointly, the aircraft's cruising range, fan size, and payload can be optimized. The 20C+2C battery scheme can either increase the cruising range by 27.3% without changing the fan diameter or increase the cruising range by 6.1% when the fan diameter is reduced to 1.1 m. Wherein without changing the fan diameter, the battery mass can be reduced from 720 kg to 571 kg while satisfying the takeoff and cruising requirements. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of improving the cruising range and optimizing the fan size and payload.}

    abstract = { This paper studies transition trajectory optimization for a tiltwing electrical vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft configuration and evaluates the benefits of equipping it with fluid injection active flow control (AFC). Using a three-degree-of-freedom model of the aircraft’s longitudinal dynamics, both hover-to-cruise (forward) and cruise-to-hover (backward) transition are investigated for a range of center-of-gravity (CG) positions to determine minimum-energy trajectories that achieve zero altitude variation while avoiding wing aerodynamic stall. It is demonstrated that constant-altitude transition can be achieved in the forward direction (with or without AFC), whereas the use of AFC in backward transition reduces the total altitude change by 24\%. A comparative constant-altitude backward transition solution using a different airfoil with a higher stall limit suggests that a redesign of the tail wing of this unique tiltwing aircraft could better leverage the benefits of using AFC in this application. Additionally, it is also shown that, in the case of forward transition, AFC can be used to decrease the total transition time and increase the range of CG positions where constant-altitude transition can occur. }

The control design for such vehicle exploits advanced robust control strategies (H∞ design methods) to offer a single control law covering over a wide range of flight conditions in each operation mode (helicopter and airplane). The stability metrics, in addition to the frequency and time domain properties of the linearised closed-loop, are examined before the controllers are tested on the nonlinear model to enhance confidence. The transition between the 2 operation modes is controlled based on a feedforward scheduling technique typical for tilt-rotor configurations. The performance of the proposed control laws is tested in a whole flight simulation performed on the nonlinear model. We observe that the control outcome is successful, in the sense that no significant changes in the flight properties are recorded during the transition period, and the H∞ controllers are able to stabilise the vehicle and follow the reference signals quickly. The control methods in this work are appealing in a practical context because of the lower implementation requirements, more accurate robustness measures and more transparent design process. }

abstract = { Urban Air Mobility (UAM) presents an innovative solution for intra-urban and inter-urban transportation, promising enhanced flexibility, efficiency, and sustainability. However, the integration of UAM into densely populated city environments brings significant challenges, particularly in the precision landing of multi-rotor vehicles amid complex and dynamic urban landscapes. To address this challenge, our paper introduces a novel convex optimization approach to solve the high-fidelity landing problem of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles. In our method, we first conceptualize the eVTOL vehicle landing trajectory optimization as a high-dimensional, highly nonconvex optimal control problem. We then implement a series of convenient convexification techniques to transform this problem into a convex form. The core of our approach lies in the application of sequential convex programming (SCP), an advanced method known for its efficacy and real-time performance in handling complex optimization challenges. We conduct a comparative analysis of our SCP-based solution with results obtained from the GPOPS-II solver, a widely recognized general-purpose tool in optimal control. This comparison not only benchmarks the performance of our method but also highlights its potential advantages in solving complicated, dynamic trajectory optimization problems in the context of UAM. }

Under the urban air mobility (UAM) concept, electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft can use the third dimension of the urban space for various transportation needs. However, the energy required to complete an UAM mission by an eVTOL vehicle must be less than the available energy stored in the battery pack. Furthermore, eVTOL vehicles must fly along the feasible paths, such as avoiding collisions with any obstacles to arrive at the destination vertiport safely. The objective of this paper is to develop a convex optimization approach for the trajectory optimization of a multi-phase eVTOL mission, including cruise, descent, and landing under various operational constraints in real time.

abstract = {Electric aviation is being developed as a new mode of transportation for the urban areas of the future. This requires urban air space management that considers these aircraft. Flight routes need to be determined that avoid no-fly areas, and minimize flight time, energy consumption and added noise. Yet, no method currently exists for optimizing urban flight routes under multiple conflicting objectives while avoiding three-dimensional restricted areas. In our work, this research gap is overcome by optimizing 3D-routes with the multi-criteria optimization technique called Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II. We propose a novel procedure in the optimization process to incorporate geographical representations. Furthermore, we include a seeding procedure for initializing the flight routes and repair methods for invalid flight routes that may arise during the optimization process. We apply the optimization to a case study in Manhattan (New York City) for two different aircraft types, the Lilium Jet (vectored thrust) and the EHANG 184 (wingless multicoptor), under three objectives concerning flight time, energy consumption and added noise. Compared to a least-distance path, flight routes were obtained with maximum improvements of 38% in added noise, 65% in flight time and 52% in energy consumption for the EHANG 184. For the Lilium jet, maximum improvements of 43% in added noise, 47% in flight time and 47% in energy consumption were obtained. Still, the obtained noise addition levels by the aircraft in New York City exceed 5 dB, which is considered as long-term noise annoyance. We illustrated that minimizing the added noise requires high search effort compared to the other two objectives. Upon further analysis of the optimization results, we conclude that the Lilium jet as representative of the eVTOL type vectored thrust is more sensitive to flight route changes than the multicoptor EHANG 184. This information may help in air taxi type choice for a certain region as well as in flight route planning.}

ABSTRACT = {Electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft attract attention due to their unique characteristics of reduced noise, moderate pollutant emission, and lowered operating cost. However, the benefits of electric vehicles, including eVTOL aircraft, are critically challenged by the energy density of batteries, which prohibit long-distance tasks and broader applications. Since the takeoff process of eVTOL aircraft demands excessive energy and couples multiple subsystems (such as aerodynamics and propulsion), multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) become essential. Conventional MDAO, however, iteratively evaluates high-fidelity simulation models, making the whole process computationally intensive. Surrogates, in lieu of simulation models, empower efficient MDAO with the premise of sufficient accuracy, but naive surrogate modeling could result in an enormous training cost. Thus, this work develops a twin-generator generative adversarial network (twinGAN) model to intelligently parameterize takeoff power and wing angle profiles of an eVTOL aircraft. The twinGAN-enabled surrogate-based takeoff trajectory design framework was demonstrated on the Airbus A3 Vahana aircraft. The twinGAN provisioned two-fold dimensionality reductions. First, twinGAN generated only realistic trajectory profiles of power and wing angle, which implicitly reduced the design space. Second, twinGAN with three variables represented the takeoff trajectory profiles originally parameterized using 40 B-spline control points, which explicitly reduced the design space while maintaining sufficient variability, as verified by fitting optimization. Moreover, surrogate modeling with respect to the three twinGAN variables, total takeoff time, mass, and power efficiency, reached around 99% accuracy for all the quantities of interest (such as vertical displacement). Surrogate-based, derivative-free optimizations obtained over 95% accuracy and reduced the required computational time by around 26 times compared with simulation-based, gradient-based optimization. Thus, the novelty of this work lies in the fact that the twinGAN model intelligently parameterized trajectory designs, which achieved implicit and explicit dimensionality reductions. Additionally, twinGAN-enabled surrogate modeling enabled the efficient takeoff trajectory design with high accuracy and computational cost reduction.},

ABSTRACT = {Electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft have attracted tremendous attention nowadays due to their flexible maneuverability, precise control, cost efficiency, and low noise. The optimal takeoff trajectory design is a key component of cost-effective and passenger-friendly eVTOL systems. However, conventional design optimization is typically computationally prohibitive due to the adoption of high-fidelity simulation models in an iterative manner. Machine learning (ML) allows rapid decision making; however, new ML surrogate modeling architectures and strategies are still desired to address large-scale problems. Therefore, we showcase a novel regression generative adversarial network (regGAN) surrogate for fast interactive optimal takeoff trajectory predictions of eVTOL aircraft. The regGAN leverages generative adversarial network architectures for regression tasks with a combined loss function of a mean squared error (MSE) loss and an adversarial binary cross-entropy (BC) loss. Moreover, we introduce a surrogate-based inverse mapping concept into eVTOL optimal trajectory designs for the first time. In particular, an inverse-mapping surrogate takes design requirements (including design constraints and flight condition parameters) as input and directly predicts optimal trajectory designs, with no need to run design optimizations once trained. We demonstrated the regGAN on optimal takeoff trajectory designs for the Airbus A3 Vahana. The results revealed that regGAN outperformed reference surrogate strategies, including multi-output Gaussian processes and conditional generative adversarial network surrogates, by matching simulation-based ground truth with 99.6% relative testing accuracy using 1000 training samples. A parametric study showed that a regGAN surrogate with an MSE weight of one and a BC weight of 0.01 consistently achieved over 99.5% accuracy (denoting negligible predictive errors) using 400 training samples, while other regGAN models require at least 800 samples.},

ABSTRACT = {Electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft represent a crucial aviation technology to transform future transportation systems. The unique characteristics of eVTOL aircraft include reduced noise, low pollutant emission, efficient operating cost, and flexible maneuverability, which in the meantime pose critical challenges to advanced power retention techniques. Thus, optimal takeoff trajectory design is essential due to immense power demands during eVTOL takeoffs. Conventional design optimizations, however, adopt high-fidelity simulation models in an iterative manner resulting in a computationally intensive mechanism. In this work, we implement a surrogate-enabled inverse mapping optimization architecture, i.e., directly predicting optimal designs from design requirements (including flight conditions and design constraints). A trained inverse mapping surrogate performs real-time optimal eVTOL takeoff trajectory predictions with no need for running optimizations; however, one training sample requires one design optimization in this inverse mapping setup. The excessive training cost of inverse mapping and the characteristics of optimal eVTOL takeoff trajectories necessitate the development of the regression generative adversarial network (regGAN) surrogate. We propose to further enhance regGAN predictive performance through the transfer learning (TL) technique, creating a scheme termed regGAN-TL. In particular, the proposed regGAN-TL scheme leverages the generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture consisting of a generator network and a discriminator network, with a combined loss of the mean squared error (MSE) and binary cross-entropy (BC) losses, for regression tasks. In this work, the generator employs design requirements as input and produces optimal takeoff trajectory profiles, while the discriminator differentiates the generated profiles and real optimal profiles in the training set. The combined loss facilitates the generator training in the dual aspects: the MSE loss targets minimum differences between generated profiles and training counterparts, while the BC loss drives the generated profiles to share analogous patterns with the training set. We demonstrated the utility of regGAN-TL on optimal takeoff trajectory designs for the Airbus A3 Vahana and compared its performance against representative surrogates, including the multi-output Gaussian process, the conditional GAN, and the vanilla regGAN. Results showed that regGAN-TL reached the 99.5% generalization accuracy threshold with only 200 training samples while the best reference surrogate required 400 samples. The 50% reduction in training expense and reduced standard deviations of generalization accuracy achieved by regGAN-TL confirmed its outstanding predictive performance and broad engineering application potential.},

The study evaluates the influence of fidelity in trajectory design by comparing the use of two aerodynamic methods in the context of trajectory optimization. The mid-fidelity method utilizes a vortex lattice method (VLM) to model lifting surfaces while employing blade element momentum theory (BEMT) to model rudimentary rotor-wing interactions. The high-fidelity approach applies a vortex particle method (VPM) to model the wing and propeller geometries while capturing more complex wake interactions. This work also presents a trajectory optimization methodology that is well suited for high fidelity VPM simulations and overcomes many of the challenges associated with traditional methods such as robust convergence and computational cost. The new method is validated through a case study which leverages the VLM-BEMT model to compare results with that of a traditional shooting method. The method is then employed to optimize trajectories using the VPM to model both conventional and eVTOL aircraft. }

    abstract = { Technological advances in areas such as battery technology, autonomous control, and ride-hailing services, combined with the scale-free nature of electric motors, have sparked significant interest in electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for urban air mobility. In this work, we use simplified models for the aerodynamics, propulsion, propeller–wing flow interaction, and flight mechanics to carry out gradient-based optimization studies for the takeoff-to-cruise trajectory of a tandem tilt-wing eVTOL aircraft. We present results for optimizations with and without stall and acceleration constraints, with varying levels of flow augmentation from propellers, and find that the optimal takeoffs involve stalling the wings or flying near the stall angle of attack. However, we find that the energy penalty for avoiding stall is practically negligible. Additionally, we find that without acceleration constraints, the optimized trajectories involve rapidly transitioning to forward flight and accelerating, followed by climbing at roughly constant speed, and then accelerating to the required cruise speed. With an acceleration constraint for passenger comfort, the transition, climb, and acceleration phases are more gradual and less distinct. We also present results showing the impact of wing loading and available power on the optimized trajectories. }

ABSTRACT = {Electric tilt-wing flying cars are an efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly solution to urban traffic congestion and travel efficiency issues. This article addresses the high energy consumption and obstacle interference during the takeoff phase of the tilt-wing eVTOL (electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing), proposing a trajectory planning method based on energy minimization and obstacle avoidance. Firstly, based on the dynamics analysis, the relationship between energy consumption, spatial trajectory, and obstacles is sorted out and the decision variables for the trajectory planning problem with obstacle avoidance are determined. Secondly, based on the power discretization during the takeoff phase, the energy minimization objective function is established and the constraints of performance limitations and spatial obstacles are derived. Thirdly, by integrating the optimization model with the SLSQP (Sequential Least Squares Quadratic Programming algorithm), the second-order sequential quadratic programming model and decision variable update equations are derived, establishing the solution process for the trajectory planning problem of the tilt-wing eVTOL takeoff with obstacle avoidance. Finally, the Airbus Vahana A3 is taken as an example to verify and validate the effectiveness, stability, and robustness of the model and optimization algorithm proposed. The validation results show that the OTPEM (obstacle avoidance trajectory planning methodology based on energy minimization) can effectively handle changes in the takeoff end state and exhibits good stability and robustness in different obstacle environments. It can provide a certain reference for the three-dimensional obstacle avoidance trajectory planning of Airbus Vahana A3 and other tilt-wing eVTOL trajectory planning problems.},

Complex aerodynamic interactions and a hard-to-predict transition maneuver from hover to wing-borne flight are one challenge in their development. To address this, we compare three different interaction models of varying fidelity for optimizing the transition trajectory of a biplane tailsitter. The first model accounts for simplified rotor-on-wing interactions using momentum theory, while the other two account for wing-on-wing interactions using a vortex lattice method and rotor-on-wing aerodynamic interactions using blade element momentum theory. One includes the swirl component of velocity and the other neglects swirl. To determine the trajectory, we perform direct collocation on the lowest fidelity model using gradient-based optimization. To compare them, we use the same control inputs obtained in the optimization to integrate trajectories using the higher fidelity models. We find that the higher fidelity models predict power and stall significantly more conservatively than the lowest fidelity model. We conclude that modeling the swirl velocity of the rotor wake and the selected stall model play a significant role in defining the transition trajectory. }

In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.}

    abstract = { Accurate dynamics modeling is crucial for the safety and control of fixed-wing aircraft under perturbation (e.g. icing/fault). In this work, we propose a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (PI-NODE)-based scheme for aircraft dynamics modeling under icing/fault. First, icing accumulation and control surface faults are considered and injected into the nominal (clean) aircraft dynamics model. Second, the physics knowledge of aircraft dynamics modeling is divided into kinematics and kinetics. The former is universally applicable and borrows directly from the nominal aircraft. The latter kinetics knowledge, which hinges on external forces and moments, is inaccurate and challenging under icing/fault. To address this issue, we employ Neural ODE to compensate for the residual between the aircraft dynamics under icing/fault and the nominal (clean) condition, resulting in a naturally continuous-time modeling approach. In experiments, we benchmark the proposed PI-NODE against three baseline methods in a dedicated flight scenario. Comparative studies validate the higher accuracy and improve the generalization ability of the proposed PI-NODE for aircraft dynamics modeling under icing/fault. }

    abstract = { A novel formulation of the vortex particle method (VPM) is developed for large-eddy simulation (LES) in a meshless scheme that is numerically stable. A new set of VPM governing equations are derived from the LES-filtered Navier–Stokes equations. The new equations reinforce the conservation of angular momentum by resizing vortex elements subject to vortex stretching. In addition to the VPM reformulation, a new anisotropic dynamic model of subfilter-scale (SFS) vortex stretching is developed. This SFS model is well suited for turbulent flows with coherent vortical structures, where the predominant cascade mechanism is vortex stretching. The mean and fluctuating components of turbulent flow and Reynolds stresses are validated through the simulation of a turbulent round jet. The computational efficiency of the scheme is showcased in the simulation of an aircraft rotor in hover, showing our meshless LES to be 100 times faster than a mesh-based LES with similar fidelity. The implementation of our meshless LES scheme is released as open-source software, called FLOWVPM. }
