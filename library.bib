abstract = {The retrofitting projects have been considered in many countries to convert simple gas turbine units into more advanced cycle units with higher efficiency and higher output. Among many proven technologies, such as inlet air cooling, intercooling, regeneration, reheat and steam injection gas turbine etc., pulse combustion is one of the promising technologies in boosting both the output capactiy and thermal efficiency, and reducing carbon and nitrogen oxides emissions without aditional pollution contorl equipment. This paper presnets the analysis of potential and real benefits of pulse combustion technology applied in the combustion process of a simple gas turbine cycle under different operating conditions. In addition, this study investigates the utilization of converting part of chemical energy of fuel into pressure energy in the gas turbine pulse combustion chamber. The influence of the maximum pressure rise due to pulse combustion (pre-compression parameter), the ratio of combustion heat released in the isochoric process, maximum cycle temperature, and compressor pressure ratio on the performance parameters such as net work output, cycle temperature, and compressor pressure ratio on the performance parameters such as net work output, cycle thermal efficiency, and fuel consuption were also investigated. Finally, the results of comparative analyses between a simple gas turbine cycle utilizing a pulse combustor and a conventional cycle show the thermodynamic advantages of applying this technology in simple gas turbine power cycles.},

This paper considers the different means to measure values that would be needed to determine engine performance.

Thermocouples - temperature of inlet air to compressor and exit air
Pressure transducers - pressure of inlet air to compressor and exit air

In previous work, the lance has been micromachined as part of an on-chip microelectromechanical system. This work investigates a Stand-Alone Lance concept, where the lance and other components are independent of a common substrate. The Stand-Alone Lance may make nanoinjection more accessible to researchers and be more compatible with lab equipment commonly available in transgenic facilities. Required parameters for the electrode are investigated using a mathematical computer model. Different materials and fabrication processes for the metal lance are also considered. Additional testing was performed using tungsten probes, including mock injections on mouse egg cells. Based upon the optimistic cell viability rate, it is recommended to further investigate the use of the Stand- Alone Lance to perform nanoinjections.},

abstract = {The Minimum Quadratic Difference (MQD) method is compared with methods conventionally used for the evaluation of PIV recordings, i.e. correlation-based evaluation with fixed interrogation windows (auto-or cross-correlation) and correlation-based tracking. The comparison is performed by studying the evaluation accuracy achieved when applying these methods to pairs of synthetic PIV recordings for which the true displacements are known. The influence of the magnitude of the particle image displacement, evaluation window size, density of particle image distribution, and particle image size on the accuracy are investigated. In all these cases the best results in terms of a statistical error are obtained with the MQD method. The superiority of the MQD method can be explained with its potential of accounting for non- uniformities in the particle image distribution and a non- uniform illumination. It is also shown that the conventional correlation-based methods may produce principal errors that are non-existent for the MQD method. The evaluation speed achievable for the MQD method by making use of the FFT is comparable to that common for the generally used auto-or cross-correlation algorithm. Finally, a quantitative explanation is given for the often observed phenomenon that PIV velocity results tend to be smaller than the true values.},

annote = {Mass and energy are conserved quantities over a period, so it is not ambiguous to calculate the actual work over a period. Different methods of calculating efficiency can yield different results, in this case 10 points.
        
The unsteady pertubations can be assumed to be periodic. The increased efficiency of a PDC can be washed out by the poor turbine efficiencies./
        
Two methods are presented for calculating efficiency for unsteady flow through a turbine. The first method involves no averaging of the total pressure and bases the calculation of ideal work on an integral over the cycle. The second method utilizes a time average of the turbine inflows and outflows to calculate the ideal work.
        
The first method integrates the density, velocity, and temperature over the inlet and exit areas and over the period of the unsteady flow. For the ideal work the turbine is assumed to instantaneously expand the flow.
        
In the second method, ways to obtain averaged values for the pressure and temperature are presented. For the inflow, it is assumed that the flow is expanded from a varying inlet pressure to a steady exit pressure. For the outflow, it is assumed that the flow is being expanded from steady inlet conditions to the unsteady, but periodic, outflow conditions.
        
A numerical model of pulse detonation interaction with the turbine was created. The different methods of calculating turbine efficiency were used on the data. The first method (time resolved method) yielded an efficiency about 10 points higher than the second method (time averaged/work averaged).
        
Gains in efficiency from using pressure gain combustion might be undone by poor efficiencies in the turbine. pg 1

abstract = {Wall-mounted roughness features, such as ribs, are often placed along the walls of a channel to increase the convective surface area and to augment heat transfer and mixing by increasing turbulence. Depending on the relative roughness size and orientation, the ribs also have varying degrees of increased pressure losses. Designs that use ribs to promote heat transfer encompass the full range of having only a few streamwise ribs, which do not allow fully developed flow conditions, to multiple streamwise ribs, which do allow the flow to become fully developed. The majority of previous studies have focused on perturbing the geometry of the rib with little attention to the spatially and temporally varying flow characteristics and their depen- dence on the Reynolds number. A staggered rib-roughened channel study was performed using time-resolved digital particle image velocimetry (TRDPIV). Both the developing (entry region) and a fully developed region were interro- gated for three Reynolds numbers of 2,500, 10,000, and 20,000. The results indicate that the flow was more sensi- tive to Reynolds number at the inlet than within the fully developed region. Despite having a similar mean-averaged flowfield structure over the full Reynolds number range investigated, the population and distribution of coherent structures and turbulent dissipation within the fully devel- oped region were also found to be Reynolds number N.

Exploring the time-accurate flow characteristics revealed that in addition to vortices shed from the rib shear layer, the region of the rib wake was governed by a peri- odic process of bursting of the wake vortices resulting in the intermittent ejection of the inter-rib recirculation region into the core flow. This periodic process was the driving mechanism resulting in mixing and heat transfer augmen- tation. A quadrant-splitting burst analysis was also per- formed to determine the characteristic frequency and duration of inter-rib bursting as well as the wake shedding frequency, both of which were determined to be Reynolds number dependent.},

abstract = {Two methods, an ejector pump and a turbo-charger, are evaluated as a means to self-aspirate a Pulsed Detonation Engine (PDE). For the experiments pertaining to the ejector pump, a pulsed detonation engine is run on hydrogen and air at frequencies up to 40 Hz, equivalence ratios from 0.5 to 1.0, and fill fractions from 0.25 to 1.0. Flow visualization is used to determine the combination of fill fraction and equivalence ratio that successfully induced a secondary flow in the ejector pump. Pressure traces at the inlet and along the ejector pump are used to understand the performance of the ejector pump. The induced secondary flow is found to be approximately triple the primary detonation flow. Fill fraction and equivalence ratio are found to affect the performance of the ejector. High fill fractions and high equivalence ratios results in an oscillatory flow at the ejector inlet. Hydrogen and air are used as the fuel and oxidizer during the experiment with the turbo-charger also. Air flow and pressure at the exit of the compressor are used to evaluate the potential for self-aspirating the PDE. By running two detonation tubes simultaneously through the turbo-charger self- aspiration is achieved. The centrifugal style turbine and compressor of the turbo-charger showed no signs of discoloration or pitting after a 25 minute self-aspiration run where the detonation tube and turbo-charger attained thermal equilibrium. Throughout the course of the testing the turbine experienced 35K plus detonation events and reached a rotational operating speed of 80K rpm.},

annote = {Ejector and turbo-charger are investigated as a means to self-aspirate a PDE. pg 1
        
Automotive cylinder head was used to control the flow of air into the PDE. Three different configurations of the ejector with detonator tubes were used in the experiment: a 2" diameter ejector opening, a 6" diameter ejector opening, and a 6" diameter ejector opening with a 5" diameter reflector plate at the end of the detonation tube. A "hot-wire" velocity sensor was used to measure the induced airflow. Since the "hot-wire" velocity sensor is not sensitive to direction, flow visualization was necessary to determine the direction of flow. Flow visualization was accomplished using a paper towel and a weighted string. These were then observed when the experiment was conducted. For the turbocharger experiment, two detonation tubes were used in parallel. Part of the exhaust was ducted through a turbine. The compressor exit was connected to the intake manifold of the detonation tubes. A mass flow sensor was connected to the compressor inlet.
        
At higher fill fractions and equivalence ratios the induced secondary flow was oscillatory because of reflected shock waves. However, steady secondary flow could be induced with lower fill fractions and equivalence ratios. Also, this induced secondary flow was greater than the needed flow for self-aspiration.
        
The compressor was used to self-aspirate the PDE with power derived from the PDE exhaust through the turbine. However, purge air was still supplied from the facility compressors. The self-aspirated run with the turbocharger was conducted for 25 minutes.
        
This paper shows that a PDE can be successfully self-aspirated either through an ejector pump or a turbocharger.},

A technique for cross correlation called robust phase correlation (RPC) is used which is an improvement on the standard cross correlation technique. Significant improvements in accuracy and vector detection were noted in the study.
        
Three different types of sand were used to seed the flow to simulate particles entering the cooling passages of a gas turbine engine. It was observed that paricles with a low Stokes number followed the flow better, as was predicted. Particles with a larger Stokes number kept their own trajectories longer and were not as affected by the motion of the fluid since their inertias were more important. The results showed that some of the assumption in analytical models are false. These assumptions include perfectly elastic collisions between particles and a particle and the wall, no particle breakup, and the particles follow the streamlines.},

abstract = {An experimental study is conducted to investigate matching USAF Group I/II RPA propeller performance to an engine map and RPA mission to maximize efficiency and range. Performance characterization of the Fuji Imvac BF-34EI engine is presented. Propeller performance is characterized for 28 commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) propellers in a vertical wind tunnel using a pneumatic motor to drive the propeller. Propeller thrust, torque, and rotational speed are measured at different forward velocities to characterize propeller efficiency. An uncertainty analysis at a characteristic point is conducted for the measured values and is found to be 3.9\%. RPA mission profile requirements are presented. A method to compare different propellers is presented. Propellers are first sorted and downselected by required rate of climb (ROC) for RPA take-off/climb-out conditions. The remaining propellers are then further downselected based on minimizing fuel consumption for RPA cruise conditions. It is discovered that performance differences can occur even between propellers of the same nominal size but from different manufacturers. Of the limited number of propellers characterized in this study, the APC C2 17x10, Top Flight PP 18x12, and APC C3 22x10 are determined to be the best matched COTS propellers in their respective diameter classes to the Fuji Imvac BF-34EI. The data used in the selection process and more detailed data for the three aforementioned propellers is presented. Propeller data for each of the three propellers is overlaid on a typical USAF Group I/II RPA engine map. Even among propellers of the same diameter, mission duration can be extended as much as 100 miles (20\%) by selecting the optimal propeller for a given engine.},

abstract = {An experimental study assessed the feasibility of utilizing a fully ported ball valve to inject fuel/air mixture into the thrust tubes of a Pulsed Detonation Engine (PDE). A fully ported, two inch ball valve was installed upstream of a detonation tube and rotated at constant speed. A solenoid controlled purge flow was replaced with a water injection event when the airflow proved insufficient to cool the detonation tube and burned gases. The water injection at the end of each cycle prevented premature ignition of fresh incoming mixture of ethylene/air, but failed to prevent premature ignition of hydrogen/air mixture. Measurements of pressure drop across the valve, detonation wave speeds, and detonation tube temperature were collected to verify successful operation of the engine. Leakage of combustible mixture was noted when the valve was closed at the end of testing. Disassembly of the valve after experiments revealed wear and charring of the valve seal. Performance characteristics are compared to a similar engine configuration utilizing a poppet valve equipped automotive cylinder head to control mixture and purge air timing. The measurements of total pressure loss show that the ball valve presents significantly less restriction to flow, but the valve also displayed a propensity to backfire due to leakage between the PTFE seals and the ball.

The work presented follows up experiments performed at the Air Force Research Lab evaluating the performance of a Garret GT2860RS turbocharger driven by a pulse detonation combustor (PDC). Results from testing showed an improvement in specific power over that of typical constant pressure combustion. The current objective is the integration and testing of an axial turbine driven by a rotary detonation engine (RDE) to determine flow characteristics and turbine performance. In pursuit of this objective, a convergent nozzle section was placed on the RDE to simulate the back pressurization that will occur when placing the turbine behind the RDE. Results show that the nozzle has a destabilizing effect on the detonation, leading to slower detonation velocities and greater variations in the peak and baseline pressures of the RDE. An analysis of the shock diamonds that form in the exhaust estimates the exit pressure of the nozzle to be 1.8 times greater than atmospheric pressure for a mass flow of 41.9 lbm/min and an equivalence ratio of 1.22.},

abstract = {Peak flame temperatures in aluminum particle combustion should approach the volatilization tempera- ture of the product alumina. References are divided in assigning this temperature anywhere between 3200 and 4000 K, which can provide significant uncertainty not only in numerical models for combustion but also in the interpretation of flame structure from temperature measurements. We present results in the controlled conditions of the UIUC heterogeneous shock tube of volatilization temperature, made by measuring the extinction of light by nano- and micro-alumina particles at non-resonant wavelengths at different ambient temperatures. At 10 atm, there is a sharp cutoff at 3860 K beyond which nano-par- ticles volatilize and stop extinguishing within the shock tube test time. Numerical modeling of the evap- oration rate of these particles is used to assign a volatilization temperature of 4340 K at 10 atm. Similarly, a volatilization temperature of 4260 K at 3 atm is measured. From our analysis, the best estimate for the volatilization temperature at 1 atm was 4189 ± 200 K, which is consistent with the high range of volatil- ization temperature reported in the literature.},

@article{Rasheed2011:Experimental,
annote = {The focus of this paper was on investigating the performance of the turbine as well as the overall efficiency of the system. There were 8 pulse detonation tubes arranged in a can-annular configuration and were fed into a axial turbine. The turbine was nominally rated for 10 lbm/s, 25,000 rpm and 1000 hp. The tubes were operated up to frequencies of 30 Hz and the operating conditions went up to 8 lbm/s, 22,000 rpm and 750 hp. C2H4 was used as the fuel and was mixed stoichiometrically with air.
        
The pulse detonation tubes share a common air inlet as well as an exit. This common exit allows for some mixing before the air enters the turbine. The mixing area is 4.2 inches long. The setup used the following instrumentation: 1/8" Type K shielded thermocouples to measure flow temperature, piezoelectric pressure sensors to measure static pressure, optical pyrometer to measure temperatures, orifice plates to measure mass flow, accelerometers, proximity probes for rotor dynamics, strain gauges and an optical blade tip deflection measurement system. The thermocouples were positions about the middle of the flow field; some were positioned in line with a pulse detonation tube, while others were offset. A high-speed DAQ (1 MHz) was used to recorde the pressure and ion probe data.
        
Detonation wave velocity - ion probes
Flow temperature - thermocouples
Static pressure - piezoelectric pressure transducer
Mass flow - orifice plate
Rotor dynamics - proximity probes, strain gauges, optical blade tip deflection system
        
NOTE: I believe that vitiated means mixed air. Therefore, the vitiated tests are run with a mixture of fuel and air and the non-vitiated tests are run with just air.
        
Four different types of tests were run. First, the turbine was installed in its native configuration and steady flow was run through the turbine. Second, the turbine was placed in the experimental rig and heated air was run through the turbine. Third, a steady burner was placed upstream of the turbine. Fourth, the PDCs were fired into the turbine. For the PDC firing condition both sequential and simultaneous firing was performed.
        
It is possible that the turbine performance would decrease from steady state, but that the efficiency fo the entire engine would increase. This is because the turbine is run as a condition for which it is not designed, but more energy is being extracted from the fuel due to the detonations. The turbine work was meaured using the compressor work and frictional losses in the bearings. The compressor work was calculated by using the change in enthalpy across the compressor and the bearing friction was calculated using the change in temperature of the oil. The efficiency of the turbine was calculated using the above indirect work as well as the isentropic work calculated using turbine inlet conditions. The inlet temperature had significant error and, therefore, was measured six different ways: flow temperature, stator blade temperature, exit gas temperature based on O2 concentration, combustor exit gas temperature based on CO2 concentration, temperature estimated from power and measured downstream thermocouples, and combustor exit gas temperature based on equivalence ratio corrected for UHCs.
        
Normalized power and efficiency were plotted versus pressure ratio for each condition. No distinction in performance could be determined for the turbine component within the uncertainty of the instrumentation. Different firing patterns were also tested, but no difference was observed with the existing instrumentation. Simultaneous firing of the pulse detonation tube sounded the smoothest, but also resulted in rupturing of the burst disk. Sequential firing sounded choppy most likely due to the defraction of pressure waves into the other tubes.
        
The efficiency of the entire rig was estimated using the equation $\backslash$eta = $\backslash$frac\{W\_\{turbine\}\}\{W\_c + Q\_\{in\}\}. The heat in was calculated from the change in enthalpy across the PDC tubes and using the energy content of the burned fuel. The compressor work was the work required by the facility compressor to bring air from ambient conditions to the inlet conditions of the rig. The PDC-fired configuration showed a four point increase in efficiency of the overall rig from steady state operation.
        
One recommendation is to directly couple the PDC tubes to the turbine rotor. Another recommendation is to design a turbine optimized for PDC-fired operation.
        
It is possible that the turbine efficiency under unsteady operation will be lower than under steady operation, but that the rig efficiency will be the opposite. This could happen if the unsteady losses were outweight by the benefits of detonation combustion.},

abstract = {Due to the transient operation of short duration facilities (0.2-1.0s running time), fidelity in temperature reproduction requires both minimum steady-state errors and a frequency response above 20 HZ. Even with the smallest thermocouple wire diameter (\~{}12microm), badly designed probes may suffer from unsteady heat conduction between wires and supports. The resulting error is often much larger than steady errors such as the effect of recovery factor. In this paper, the origins of steady and unsteady measurement errors are described and evaluated. An analytical modeling of the transient convection/conduction problem is presented. A number of probe designs are described and evaluated at different Reynolds number. The dynamic response is tested in a hot jet apparatus that generates temperature steps with jet velocities up to 150 m/s. The influence of the length/diameter ratio, the type of support and the presence of a shield on the dynamic response are addressed. The unsteady behavior of a thermocouple probe can be replicated with a combination of first order systems, which defines the transfer function of the probe. The relevant parameters are found by using an optimization routine that fits the numerical system response to the experimental response. This numerical model can be reversed to perform a frequency compensation of the measured data.},

abstract = {Pulse Detonation combustors (PDCs), as part of a hybrid PDC-turbine engine, have potential thermodynamic benefits over existing Brayton-cycle gas turbine. The form of combustion is a cyclic, controlled series of detonations. These systems apply a near or quasi-constant volume combustion process that provides both heat addition and pressure. In a hybrid PDC-turbine engine, the goal of incorporation a pulsed detonation chamber upstream of a turbine s to extract more mechanical energy in a turbine that receives the products of a repeating, pressure-rise detonation process versus the constant pressure, steady-flows available in conventional gas turbines. A rig was built to investigate PDC-turbine interactions and was operated to gather data on performance, operability, and noise levels. The rig consists of a single pused detonation combustor firig into a partial-admission, two-stage axial turbine. This paper reports findings of critical risk areas including turbine response to PDC operation, mechanical robustness, noise and system control. At a PDC operating frequency of 5 Hz, the acoustic level near the rig was approximately 3 dB higher that from the turbine operating at the same speed with steady flow input. The noise level is 28 dB lower than a PDC with no turbine downstream operating at the same frequency and discharging directly into the room. Insights into the mechanism for noise reduction were gained via imaging experiements and CFD simulation. High speed video imaging in a 2D PDC-turbine cascade configuration showed significant shock reflection from the cascade. An unsteady, reacting flow computational study showed similar shock reflection as well as a shock system that forms downstream of the cascade. Together, these results show that ashock waves are both transmitted and reflected by the turbine stages in proporitions that are dependent upon turbine stage design.},

Summary:
        
Pulse Detonation Engines (PDEs) have potential in aircraft propulsion because of their simplicity and efficiency. Furthermore, PDEs can be used in subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic flight. This is because PDEs operate using supersonic, shock-induced combustion waves called detonations. The combustion front is coupled with the shock wave and releases energy in the form of heat that sustains the shock. The PDE process includes fill, detonation initiation, detonation propagation, blowdown, and purge.
        
In this experiment a PDE was coupled with a turbine. The PDE was operated with frequencies of 5-20Hz. A 6" diameter control valve was used to control the turbine back pressure. Bypass air was used to cool the PDE tube and to mix with the exhaust products. Mixing with the exhaust products was necessary so that the temperature limits of the turbine were not exceeded. Mixing was accomplished in a large plenum upstream of the turbine.
        
It was discovered that the presence of a turbine at the turbine exit decreased the noise levels from detonation-based combustion by 28 dB. },

annote = {Distortions in the compressor can be unsteady or steady and result from flow separation during manuevers or supersonic flight.
        
The flow is assumed to have different total pressure at the inlet, but exit at the same static pressure. Thus, the system can be modeled as two different compressors pumping from a differnt total pressure to the same static pressure. This is a good assumption because there will be little circumfrencial mixing since there is very little spacing between compressor stages. Also, the pressure gradient is the greatest during the first few stages so if any redistribution occurs it will be in this range.
        
The parallel compressor model is overly simplified, but does give qualitative information about the effects of distortion.
        
With an inlet distortion, going through a diffuser the static pressure increases while the total pressure distortion remains constant. This is because the total pressure is not changing, but the static pressure changes because the flow is changing velocity in the diffuser. The exit flow from the compressor is assumed to have uniform static pressure. While the total pressure distortion will decrease through the compressor, there will still be some difference in velocity causing total pressure distortion.
        
For non-uniform flow, there is a difference in the stagnation pressure, while the static pressure may be constant. This is because of the differences in velocity.},

Within a boundary layer, the pressure gradient normal to the streamwise direction is 0. Static pressure in duct flows is measured by a pressure tap, which is a small hole in the wall. The freestream static pressure can only be measured when there is no curvature of the streamlines. A probe inserted into the flow can also be used to measure the static pressure at a certain point.

abstract = {A methodology is described whereby the work extracted by a turbine exposed to the fundamentally non-uniform flowfield from a representative pressure gain combustor (PGC) may be assessed. The method uses an idealized constant volume cycle, often referred to as an Atkinson or Humphrey cycle, to model the PGC. Output from this model is used as input to a scalable turbine efficiency function (i.e. a map), which in turn allows for the calculation of useful work throughout the cycle. Integration over the entire cycle yields mass-averaged work extraction. The unsteady turbine work extraction is compared to steady work extraction calculations based on various averaging techniques for characterizing the combustor exit pressure and temperature. It is found that averages associated with momentum flux (as opposed to entropy or kinetic energy) provide the best match. This result suggests that momentum-based averaging is the most appropriate figure-of-merit to use as a PGC performance metric. Using the mass-averaged work extraction methodology, it is also found that the design turbine pressure ratio for maximum work extraction is significantly higher than that for a turbine fed by a constant pressure combustor with similar inlet conditions and equivalence ratio. Limited results are presented whereby the constant volume cycle is replaced by output from a detonation-based PGC simulation. The results in terms of averaging techniques and design pressure ratio are similar.},

abstract = {A rotating detonation engine (RDE), originally designed and built by Pratt \& Whitney – Seattle Aerosciences Center and on loan to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RZTC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), was rebuilt and tested. New parts were acquired, fabricated, or modified to replace those damaged or missing from initial experimentation. Originally designed for ethylene and oxygen, the RDE was modified to run on hydrogen and air while the detonation initiator uses hydrogen and oxygen. Analytical mass-flow and pressure loss equations were used to estimate combustion chamber conditions. Estimation of detonation cell size was performed via comparison to published experimental data in terms of static pressure and stoichiometry. The experimental rig was instrumented to measure feed and fill temperatures and pressures, combustion chamber temperatures and pressures, and combustion chamber wave speed. The reactant feed system was characterized in terms of mass flow and pressure. A detonation initiation device showed successful light-off of the main chamber reactants. However, cold-flow testing revealed low static pressures in the combustion chamber unfavorable to detonation propagation. Limited combustion tests showed successful and predictable light-off, but no substantial evidence of detonation combustion. Low static pressure in the combustion chamber is thought to have inhibited propagation of the detonation from the initiation device into the main chamber. Nomenclature},

abstract = {Three turbines, covering a range of reaction of +20 percent to -10 percent at their blade roots, have been tested under both steady and 'pulse flow' conditions in order to assess their degree of suitablility for turbocharger application. The results have been analysed in a way which enables efficiencies to be plotted against a mean non-dimensional blade speed irrespective of the level of pulsation. This method of presentation enables the results to be used directly for design purposes and in matching calculuations. Thus the efficiency penalty due to pulse flow, the effect of pulse flow on the choice of turbine size, and the preferred degree of reaction under pulse flow may be assessed. For the present tests the range of variaton in gas speed under pulsing conditions is thought to compare in severity with that produced when a single turbocharger is connected to three cylinders of a large two-stroke marine engine. For this case the design having the highest degree of reaction is shown to give an efficiency four percentage points higher than either of the other designs. It also has a clear advantage under steady flow. The intermediate design, having zero root reaction, corresponds to the type of turbine conventionally used in turbochargers and is shown to be the one most sensitive to losses in efficiency resulting from pulsation. It appears therefore that substantial improvements could be made in turbines for future turbocharger designs by increasing the reaction. Further testing of these turbines under modified pulse conditions, with significant windage period, is advocated. The advantage of the high reaction design must be demonstrated for such conditions before a change of design reaction could be regarded as fully justifialbe.},
annote = {Increasing the reaction of turbocharcher turbines may improve performance.
        
Assuming the flow is quasi-steady in a turbocharger yields fairly accurate results for efficiency calculations at the frequencies seen in marine diesel engines. However, the accuracy decreases for higher frequencies. Also, at higher frequencies, the mass flow through the turbocharger decreases.
        
For a multi-entry radial turbine it was found that the average turbine efficiency is greater for unsteady flow than for steady flow.
        
Total-to-static efficiency is what is used to evaluate turbochargers. During the exhaust process there is a high pressure spike at the turbine inlet during blow down, a constant pressure area during exhaust, and then a dip to a low pressure after the valve has closed.
        
The pulse generator used two parallel cylinders and valves driven by cams mounted on a central shaft. It generated 444 pulses per minute. The turbine mass flow was measured using a nozzle on the turbine exhaust and measuring total pressure on the exhaust centerline. The exit static pressure was assumed to be atmospheric. The compressor mass flow was measured also using a nozzle and measuring the static pressure of the flow. The total pressure was assumed to be atmospheric.
        
The three turbines considered in the test were calibrated with a steady air flow supply. Once with a brake and once with no load. The pulse tests were carried out with a brake compressor. To increase speed the power absorption of the brake compressor was decreased.
        
The average efficiency can be plotted against the ratio of blade speed to isentropic gas speed. The efficiency can be expressed as
$\backslash$[$\backslash$eta = $\backslash$cfrac\{$\backslash$dot m\_c c\_p $\backslash$Delta T\}\{$\backslash$int\_0\^{}\{360\} $\backslash$left( $\backslash$dot m\_t c\_p T\_\{it\} $\backslash$left[ 1 - $\backslash$left( $\backslash$cfrac\{P\_\{ds\}\}\{P\_\{it\}\} $\backslash$right)\^{}\{($\backslash$gamma - 1)/ $\backslash$gamma\} $\backslash$right] $\backslash$right) $\backslash$cfrac\{$\backslash$mathrm\{d\} $\backslash$theta\}\{360\}\}$\backslash$]
where \$T\_\{it\}\$ is the inlet total temperature of the turbine, \$P\_\{ds\}\$ is the static pressure downstream of the turbine, and \$P\_\{it\}\$ is the inlet total pressure of the turbine. The numerator is based on the compressor and the denominator is based on the turbine conditions.
        
Since the instantaneous mass flow is hard to measure, the efficiency can be expressed using steady-flow capacity curves and a correction factor to calculate the mass flow rate. An average of two different methods, one using the measured inlet total temperature and the other using a measured mean total inlet temperature (use a thermocouple with a slow response time). These two methods are then averaged to obtain a corrected mass flow and a corrected efficiency. The reference gas velocity for the unsteady case was calculated by considering a steady state operation at the same mean power, average efficiency, and average mass flow.
        
A  decrease in efficiency was seen for the unsteady condition from the steady condition. The high reaction turbine showed better performance in both the steady and unsteady condition.
        
The peak pressures induced at the turbine inlet were slightly less than 3 times atmospheric pressure.},
